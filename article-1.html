									<h2 class="text-indent section-title">Big swim day</h2>
										<h3 class="text-indent section-sub-title">A tail of swim, by Rasket.</h3>
											<p class="text-indent section-text">The day started like any other — wake, eat, snooze, play, snooze. But little did we know what the hoomans had in store for us.</p>
											<p class="text-indent section-text">The first indication came after the third snooze of the day—the sun snooze that is, not to be mistaken with the post-play snooze—when the hoomans were playing around with these big fluffy rectangles. We’ve seen these rectangles before, and they always use them after their daily wetting, when they come out of the smell changing box. So it got us wondering… Why would they be playing with these rectangles when they’re already wearing their second fur?</p>
											<p class="text-indent section-text">Then it hit our nose. <em>The stench!</em> What was that strange smell?</p>
											<p class="text-indent section-text">It was a matter of urgency, as our hoomans could be in grave danger! We needed to run. We wasted no time as we leapt from our beds and zoomed towards the wetting room. Paws slipping on the ground, claws unable to gain traction. Metres felt like miles, and it seemed as though there was a never ending gap between us and where we <em>needed</em> to be. As we approached the opening to the wetting room, still unable to gain traction, we prepared for a sideways entrance, slamming into the wall. There was no feeling, no pain, nothing else really mattered at that point. As we frantically recomposed ourselves trying to find the hoomans, we saw them in the middle of the wetting room — just standing there looking back at us.  We approached cautiously as they were rubbing some weird smelly stuff on their under-fur. I tried to lick it off to help them smell better, but that didn’t last long.</p>
											<p class="text-indent section-text"><em>“Out!”</em></p>
											<p class="text-indent section-text">We left the room, confused, but relieved that the hoomans were alive. Besides, it wasn’t long after the banishment from the wetting room that we heard the all-familiar sound of jingling. Yay! We’re going somewhere. “Where are we going?” we barked at the hoomans, but they didn’t respond. We all got into the rolling box together, and started moving away from home. We were in the rolling box for what seemed like an eternity. Harrie tried counting each tree that we passed, but the hoomans didn’t seem to like all the noise she was making. So I just sat like a good boy and watched quietly.</p>
											<p class="text-indent section-text">When we finally stopped moving, the hoomans got out of the box first, and only let us out after attaching us to them. All this excitement was too much! I started to bounce with joy. Kangaroos had nothing on the height I was getting. But that didn’t last long either. I saw it! Water — and lots of it! “Woof!” I couldn’t contain it. “Woof!” Harrie was joining in. Before I could work out what was going on, I realised we were no longer attached to the hoomans. This was our chance. My paws became a blur underneath me as I ran straight for the water, and when it was close I did the biggest bounce I’ve ever done, and leapt as far into water as possible.</p>
											<p class="text-indent section-text"><strong>This is what pure happiness feels like.</strong></p>
											<p class="text-indent section-text">Tail wagging. Hoomans smiling. The sounds, the smells — this was the best day ever. The hoomans even brought a ball to throw for me. They know I love fetch, and brought it just for me. Such wonderful hoomans. We were in another world, and I never wanted to leave.</p>
