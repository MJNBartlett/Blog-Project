									<h3 class="text-indent section-sub-title">A tail of fun, by Harrie.</h3>
									<p class="text-indent section-text">Waking up was a slow process on this particular morning. The sun was shining through the window, and warming our beds to the bestest temperature.  Why get up? I mean, there’s no rush right? After all I had everything I needed with me — Teddy, blanket, warmth, Rasket. I remember everything going dark, and my memory after that is a bit furry. I was at home, in the yard. The hoomans were throwing my favourite stick. I was moving fast—like, real fast—and I got the stick before Rasket. Victory was mine and I needed to celebrate with at least three laps of the yard. The hoomans were so impressed with me. They were cheering my name. “Harrie!” “Harrie!” “Harrie, it’s time for breakfast.”</p>
									<p class="text-indent section-text">Hang on… <em>OMG! FOOD!</em></p>
									<p class="text-indent section-text">I instantly woke up and leapt out of bed, running towards the food room. Still a bit sleepy, I ran into the wall on the way, but because I’m a tough girl I didn’t feel much. Besides, I had other priorities at that point other than my head. I was <em>so</em> hungry. Food needed to be consumed, and I was the right dog for the job! After breakfast I thought I’d have a little rest whilst the hoomans were busy. Just put my head down for a minute or two.</p>
									<p class="text-indent section-text">“Harrie!” “Harrie!” “Harrie!” They were cheering for me. I’m the bestest dog in the world. Rasket must be <em>so</em> jealous. I was zooming like no dog has ever zoomed. Dust was starting to cloud around from my speed, and for a minute I lost track of where Rasket was.</p>
									<p class="text-indent section-text"><em>*Snatch*</em></p>
									<p class="text-indent section-text">Oh no! He stole the stick. Come back! It was too late, once he had the stick I knew I wasn’t strong enough to get it back from him. The hoomans must have been so disappointed. I turned to face the hoomans, but they were gone. Something must have happened to them. “Woof” I yelled for Rasket to help, but he was gone too. I was alone, and starting to panic. “Woof” Oh no… “Woof” Things were starting to shake around me. Or so I thought.</p>
									<p class="text-indent section-text">The hoomans were back… but we were in the sleeping room. And they’re trying to wake me. Such wonderful hoomans must have known I was scared so they saved me from the sleep panic! And they even brought my lead with them… Wait, that must mean… <strong>We’re going for a walk!</strong></p>
									<p class="text-indent section-text">I don’t remember much more about the lead up to the walk, and I was way too excited to focus. Once the hoomans opened the house rectangle, I jumped at the opportunity—literally jumped—and ran until the lead wouldn’t go any more. “Let’s go!” I yelled, but I don’t think the hoomans heard because they were taking way too long to follow.</p>
									<p class="text-indent section-text">As we left the house, the warmth of the sun had me energised. I was surrounded by the most amazing smells, and got to see some of my friends walk by. I made sure to say hello to each and every one of them, because they’re all my friends, and that's what friends do! Before long we made it to the field with all the big doggos. I really like the big doggos—they’re bigger than the hoomans, and seem to be stuck behind lots of metal—but I’m not sure if they like me yet. The hoomans let me give them a sniff and say hello, but they ran away when I started happy bouncing. I don’t think they like happy bounces. After it was that starting to get late and the hoomans seemed tired, so we started to walk back home.</p>
									<p class="text-indent section-text">When we got back the hoomans gave us lost of hugs, and then started to get themselves some food. It wasn’t my food time yet, so I just decided to have another rest in the warm bed with Rasket. I was <em>so</em> happy, and this was a really good day.</p>
